#Dev Notes

* homepage psd file will be sent via yousend it.
* please use google font: "Raleway" for texts.
* in social media drop down, can you add a map icon (i can provide) there too? so ideally i want facebook, google plus and map in the that box if possible.
* bottom navigation (ART, Car accident...) when you hoover them, they will change to "original image" without color overlay and type. so for example: |you will just need to delete "ART BAR" and text "ART" to get roll over image for Active Release nav. does this make sense?
* you can adjust document width if it is too wide. it is about 1180 px wide.
* massage picture at the bottom nav has not been purchased yet as we might need to change it to something else. can i send the final pic later?
