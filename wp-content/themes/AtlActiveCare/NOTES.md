- [ ] debug the map location stuff once it's on a server
- [ ] add fb icon to contact page

*** Pink text are priority***
Yellows are done.

GLOBALLY
1. title of each page that you fixed last night where it aligned with logo... it looks good on MAC but not on desktop.
it is still sticking out to the left.
2. add icons (just like Doc Plus) "facebook" "map (6290 Abbotts Bridge Rd. Suite 204 Johns Creek, GA) " and "goggle plus (we don't have address yet)

HOMEPAGE
2. currently we see a scroll bar horizontally at the bottom, can you fix so we don't see a scroll bar? we can still have NO scroll bar with full width, right?

3. center text in white box of the big middle pic. white box stays the same (full width) so beginning of the text can be lined with logo and 4 boxes at the bottom.

7. on my mac laptop with 15 in monitor, all elements lined up and centered (google chrome) nicely but on my work desktop (21 inch monitor) top banner looks good (red bar and logo)  but 4 boxes are NOT lined up with logo.

PROVIDERS
1. when you see actual profile page for providers, can you move the whole white box/page closer to top? so ppl can less scroll.
2. change body copy to dark grey (555555) for all providers.
3. dr darcee's bio looks little messed w pictures falling in between sentences.

NEW PATIENT
2. i attached 2 pdfs for Adult and Auto accident forms. will send you Child and Notice of Privacy later.

SERVICES
4. add side bars on each page. i attached side bar comps. in the psd i have two side bar folders. one for Auto accident, others for rest of pages except for Massage.
