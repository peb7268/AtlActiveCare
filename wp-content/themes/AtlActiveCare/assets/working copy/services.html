                Active Release Techniques (ART®) is one of the most effective forms of treatment for repetitive-motion injuries,
                has helped Olympic athletes achieve gold medals, and allowed injured athletes to return quickly to their training
                protocols. With a success rate of over 90%, ART® has become one of most sought after soft tissue treatments in the
                world today. ART® is a patented, state-of-the-art soft tissue system/movement based technique that treats problems
                with muscles, tendons, ligaments, fascia and nerves. Headaches, back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, shin splints,
                shoulder pain, sciatica, plantar fasciitis, knee problems, and tennis elbow are just a few of the many conditions that can
                be resolved quickly and permanently with ART®. These conditions all have one important thing in common: they are
                often a result of overused muscles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every ART® session is a combination of examination and treatment. Dr. Lee Chiropractic uses their hands to
                evaluate the texture, tightness and movement of muscles, fascia, tendons, ligaments and nerves. Abnormal
                tissues are treated by combining precisely directed tension with very specific patient movements. These treatment
                protocols - over 500 specific moves - are unique to ART®. They allow providers to identify and correct the specific
                problems that are affecting each individual patient. ART® is NOT a cookie-cutter approach.
            </p>
            <p>
                Understanding the process of Cumulative Trauma is key to breaking the cycle of repetitive injury. After an injury
                occurs, whether it is acute or chronic, your body begins to heal the damaged tissues. The inflammatory process
                begins as the injured tissues are repaired. During this process, scar tissue is laid down (just like when you cut your
                skin) in order to strengthen the weakened structures. This scar tissue does not stretch and is considered
                "non-functional" tissue. As you become more active and begin to use that part of your body that was injured, these
                tissues are expected to stretch and slide as you move. In the presence of scar tissue, this does not happen very well
                and further injury and inflammation can occur. Decreasing the amount of scar tissue and inflammation is vital in
                decreasing injury duration, repeat injuries, and thus, avoiding a decreased performance to help you reach your
                performance goals. The Active Release Techniques are specifically designed to break this cycle and work very quickly
                and effectively to eliminate long term damage.

            <h4 class="title">AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT INJURY</h4>
             <p>
                Motor Vehicle Accidents (MVA) can result in a very diverse variety of injuries and symptoms but even a minor MVA can
                have major effects on your health. Many symptoms from an accident may take weeks or months to manifest. It is easy to
                be fooled into thinking that you are not as injured as you really are. The sooner treatment is started in relation to the
                accident the quicker the recovery.
            </p>

            <h4 class="highlight">
                Some Of The Most Common Injuries Sustained From MVA’s Are:
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Whiplash</li>
                <li>Sprains and Strains</li>
                <li>Headaches</li>
                <li>Back pain</li>
                <li>Head injuries</li>
                <li>Extremity pain numbness and tingling</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The belief among Dr. Lee Chiropractic is that it is better to use active therapy and passive therapy when treating
                musculoskeletal injuries. Dr. Lee Chiropractic utilizes active therapies such as Active Release Techniques (ART®), tool
                assisted soft tissue techniques, Kinesio Taping®, and rehab exercises in combination with chiropractic manipulation to
                maximize the patient's long-term results.
            </p>

            <h4 class="highlight">What Is Causing The Pain?</h4>

            <p>
                When soft tissue has been injured it forms scar tissue. While necessary for healing, scar tissue may attach to nearby
                structure, restricting the range of motion and may cause compression over nerves or blood vessels. Dr. Lee
                Chiropractic utilizes active therapies to break down scar tissue and adhesions that form within or between these soft
                tissues, leaving nerve and muscle tissue free to function properly and without pain.

            <h4 class="title">CHIROPRACTIC ADJUSTMENTS</h4>
            <h4 class="highlight">
                What is an Chiropractic Adjustment?
            </h4>
            <p>
                The spine is made of several bones that connect together at joints. These joints should move smoothly in all directions.
                Sometimes when there is irritation or inflammation in an area of the spine those joints stop moving the way they were
                meant to. When that happens, the muscles, nerves, ligaments, and joints all stop functioning optimally. This is what
                chiropractors call a subluxation or joint restriction. Maintaining proper joint motion is important to avoid injuries
                and/or nervous system irritation. In order to restore proper joint mechanics and motion, the doctor will direct a small
                amount of pressure (adjustment) at the specific joints which are restricted.
            </p>
            <p>
                The muscles attached to that joint have a memory for their previous position and have a tendency to pull on the
                joints even after an adjustment is given. Providing soft tissue treatments helps the muscles “remember” the new
                desired position. That is why it is important to address the muscles as well as adjust the joints at the same time.
            </p>

            <h4 class="title">
                What is Subluxation?
            </h4>

            <strong>sub = less than | luxation = dislocation</strong>
            <p>
                A subluxation is a stress response where muscles go into spasm, spinal bones lock up,and adjacent nerves are
                choked or chafed. This interferes with the control and regulation of your body and garbles communication between the
                brain and parts of your body.
            </p>

            <p>
                Distorted nerve communications can be an underlying cause of many health problems beyond just headaches and
                back pain. For example, it interferes with nerve impulses going to or from your stomach which causes stomach problems.
                Your nervous system controls every cell, tissue, organ and system of your body. These nerve impulses travel through
                your spine, so having a spine free of vertebral subluxation is essential for optimal health.
            </p>

            <p>
                Only a chiropractic examination can detect subluxations, and chiropractic adjustments is the only natural way to
                reduce their effect to your nervous system.
            </p>

            <p>
                Find out if you have subluxations before they become more serious and more difficult to correct.

            <h4 class="title">DANCE MEDICINE</h4>
            <p>
                Dance medicine is a specialized branch of medicine focusing on dancers and
                their injuries. It employs an injury diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation program
                specific to dancers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The aesthetic movements of turnout, jumping,developées and pointe work put
                repetitive stresses on the body which can ultimately create overuse injuries. Dance has
                unique demands physically and mentally, and it is important for a physician to
                understand the proper terminology, technique, and requirements rehearsing
                places on these athletes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most dance injuries are not the result of a sudden traumatic event; they are chronic, stemming from ineffective
                movement patterns developed during training. These inefficient movement patterns teach the dancer to over
                use some muscles and under use others. As the dancer continues to train, this can turn into excessive stress
                and fatigue creating overuse/chronic problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dancers generally have a good sense of how their bodies function and when they start to feel discomfort they alter
                their technique to avoid aggravating the injury. This creates imbalances and stress on inappropriate muscles,
                ligaments, and joints as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Educating the dancer on proper ways to improve their technique is vital to preventing injuries down the road.

                CROSSFIT CARE
            </h4>
            <p>
                CrossFit is the sport of fitness which combines all aspects
                of physical conditioning. CrossFit trains the body to
                function optimally as a unit and efficiency is the key point.

                This means the nervous system must be performing
                flawlessly so the muscles respond properly.

                When one area of your body becomes injured or
                shuts down, everything in your body compensates for
                that injury.

                When your body is not balanced and/or muscles are not
                firing correctly, this predisposes you to not only a poor
                performance but injury as well.

                Studies show that 84% of expectant women receiving chiropractic manipulation reported relief of back pain during
                pregnancy. There are no known contraindications to chiropractic spinal and pelvic adjustments throughout pregnancy,
                other than those affecting any non-pregnant individual.

                Getting to Know Your Anatomy
            </h4>
            <p>
                The pelvis is shaped like a bowl with the sacrum (tailbone) at the back. All the
                organs sit in the middle and connect to the pelvic bones via ligaments. There
                are two main ligaments to know during pregnancy: the round ligament and the
                utero-sacral ligament.
            </p>
            <p>
                The round ligament connects the front uterus to the groin. This ligament
                grows and stretches throughout pregnancy and prevents the uterus from
                moving backwards in the pelvic bowl. Round ligament pain is common as one
                side stretches and is strained more than another. Helpful hint: Rubbing your
                round ligaments throughout the day can help decrease discomfort.
            </p>
            <p>
                The utero-sacral ligament connects the sides of the uterus to the sacrum.
                These ligaments prevent the uterus from moving forward and down.
            </p>

                Sacral Misalignment - What it Means to You
            </h4>
            <p>
                As your body changes, the joints in your pelvis are likely to change as well. Sometimes the (a) sacrum moves
                backwards on one side, causing it to (b) pull on the utero-sacral ligament on that specific side, which then (c) pulls on
                the uterus. This creates a torque in the uterus, causing discomfort and may affect the amount of room the baby has to
                grow. Because there is a pull on the back side of the uterus, (d) the opposite round ligament on the front becomes
                strained and can create pain.

            </h4>
            <p>
                Luckily there is something that can help decrease the torque and tension of the pelvis and reestablish
                balance to the ligaments, bones, and muscles of the pelvis. Webster Technique, discovered over 30 years ago
                by Dr. Larry Webster, DC, is a specific chiropractic analysis and adjustment of the pelvis that is predominantly
                used on pregnant women. The goal of the adjustment is to reduce the effects of sacral misalignment. In doing so,
                neurological and biomechanical function in the sacral/pelvic region are improved, decreasing pain and giving mom
                and baby a better outcome.

                PEDIATRIC CARE

            <p>
                Chiropractic care can start as early as immediately following
                birth, however, your child will benefit from chiropractic care at
                any age. According to the International Chiropractic Pediatric
                Association, pediatric patients can be helped with a host of
                problems, including ADD, ear infections, coordination
                problems, headaches, general wellness, autism, sleeping
                problems, colic, food allergies, asthma, and other acute and
                chronic conditions children face during childhood.

                REHAB &amp; EXERCISES
            </h4>
            <p>
                Stretching is extremely important in the early stage of treatment. Dr. Lee Chiropractic's use of Active Release
                Techniques® will reduce muscles spasms, however, there are exercises you can do to keep the area loose between
                visits. If the affected areas are not adequately stretched between treatments, the muscles will remain tight and rigid thus
                prolonging recovery time. It is important to stay ACTIVE with your treatment.
            </p>

            <p>
                Dr. Lee Chiropractic utilizes a functional movement approach to exercise rehabilitation geared toward improving
                balance, strengthening core muscle groups and increasing muscle function and endurance. The goal of rehab
                and conditioning instructed in our clinic is to come up with a brief series of exercises, specific to the individual needs of
                each patient. Compliance rates are high with our patients because we ensure that our patients understand the purpose
                of their exercises and how those exercises help to bring both short-term and long-term relief of symptoms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Exercise design and instruction are given in the clinic for patients to perform at home with simple equipment such as
                gym balls, exercise tubing, and balance equipment. Core muscle group stabilization is the most important factor in
                prevention and recovery from injuries. Endurance of muscles that maintain proper function and stability when
                performing difficult movements is also critical in preventing injuries and expediting recovery.

                Cold Laser Therapy has been shown in numerous studies to decrease inflammation. Be aware that although many
                people believe it to be true, inflammation is not synonymous with swelling - it's much more serious than that.
                INFLAMMATION is a largely "systemic" chemical issue that causes all sorts of problems (swelling is one of many). This
                probably helps explain why Cold Laser Therapy can help so many different problems. Also, light from the Cold Laser
                stimulates cells called fibroblasts, which can speed up collagen synthesis in damaged tissue. This is a bigger deal
                than you might imagine because collagen, the most abundant protein in the body, is the building block for muscles,
                ligaments, tendons, fascia, bones, skin, and several other connective tissues.

                Electrical Muscle Stimulation is an exceptional way to help the body in the healing process. This is accomplished by
                sending a very small electrical current into the affected soft tissue injury or muscle spasm. This current helps reduce
                swelling and releases trigger points that may have the muscle locked up. It does this by aiding the release of natural
                pain relievers called endorphins. This is a great therapy if there is a spasm in a back or neck muscle. It works well in
                relaxing the muscle and allowing it to return to its normal state rather quickly. Electric stimulation can also be used for
                rehabilitation purposes to increase the strength of a weakened muscles.

                Therapeutic Ultrasound as a treatment modality that has been used by therapists over the last 50 years to treat soft
                tissue injuries. One of the greatest proposed benefits of ultrasound therapy is that it is thought to decrease the healing
                time of certain soft tissue injuries. Therapeutic ultrasound increases blood flow which can be beneficial in the sub-acute
                phase of tissue injury.
